This project aims to provide a quick web interface for viewing actual versus projected hours worked on a given project.

The purpose is to help one reach ones goals for hours worked

## Using

* Symfony 2.3
* Bootstrap 3.0?
* HaPi HarvestApp API for PHP
* Checkout: http://www.tidesdk.org/ for making it a desktop app :)

Need to have an account in http://www.harvestapp.com.
Currently, for simple needs (one project, one client) you can use HarvestApp for free.

First target is to have this running for just me in a local web env. Later, I'll investigate some way to make it accessible to others, if there's any interest.
